  <div class="class-description">
  This overview course is for Berkeley CS researchers who are curious about
  what it takes to create a world-changing company. Berkeley EECS researchers
  have led the creation of industry-defining technologies (e.g., BSD, TCP,
  RISK, RAID, Spark), as well as iconic technology startups (e.g., VMWare,
  Apple, Nicera, Inktomi, Sun Microsystems, and Tesla). We will review key
  lessons from these successes, with a focus on the first steps you can take to
  go from research to startup.
