  <div class="class-description">This overview course is for Berkeley CS researchers who are curious about what it
  takes to create a world-changing company. Berkeley EECS researchers have led
  the creation of industry-defining technologies (e.g., BSD, TCP, RISK, RAID,
  Spark), as well as iconic technology startups (e.g., VMWare, Apple, Nicera,
  Inktomi, Sun Microsystems, and Tesla). We will review key lessons from these
  successes, with a focus on the first steps you can take to go from research
  to startup.
