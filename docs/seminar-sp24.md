<p class="float: left">
This is an in-person EECS seminar for PhD students who are interested in or
currently creating startups out of research. Physical attendance is mandatory.
</p>

<p>
This class is taught by Berkeley EECS Professors and PhD alumni experienced in
starting deeply technical companies around industry-defining technologies.
</p>

We will connect you to a large network of PhD and faculty founders via guest
lectures and office hours. The network includes founders and executives at over
a dozen unicorns.

This is the third run in our Research to Startup 294 seminar series. Whereas
the first 2 classes were a high-level [intro to startups](/intro-sp22) and a
YC-inspired [launchpad](/launchpad-sp23) for students already working on startups,
this course is more of a traditional reading + discussion group and guest speaker
series.

## Logistics

This course will meet 5-6:30pm every Wednesday in 310 Soda. All communication
will be done via Slack. You will be added before class starts. You may send the
instructors a Slack direct message (or email cs294-194-staff@googlegroups.com)
if you have questions that are relevant to only you, but keep most of the
communication public to the course.
