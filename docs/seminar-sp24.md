<p class="float: left">
This is an in-person EECS seminar for PhD students who are interested in or
currently creating startups out of research. Physical attendance is mandatory.
</p>

<p>
This class is taught by Berkeley EECS Professors and PhD alumni experienced in
starting deeply technical companies around industry-defining technologies.
</p>

We will connect you to a large network of CS PhD and faculty founders and
executives at dozens of unicorns, decacorns, and centicorns.

This is the third run in our Research to Startup 294 seminar series. Whereas
the first 2 classes were a high-level [intro to startups](/intro-sp22) and a
YC-inspired [launchpad](/launchpad-sp23) for students already working on startups,
this course is more of a traditional reading + discussion group and guest speaker
series.

## Logistics

This course will meet 5-6:30pm every Wednesday in 310 Soda. All communication
will be done via Slack. You will be added before class starts. You may send the
instructors a Slack direct message (or email cs294-194-staff@googlegroups.com)
if you have questions that are relevant to only you, but keep most of the
communication public to the course.
