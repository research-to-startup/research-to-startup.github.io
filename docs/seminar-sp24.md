This is an EECS seminar for PhD students who are interested in or currently
creating startups out of research.

This class is taught by Berkeley EECS Professors and PhD alumni experienced in
starting deeply technical companies around industry-defining technologies.

We will connect you to a large network of PhD and faculty founders via guest
lectures and office hours. The network includes founders and executives at over
a dozen unicorns.

This is the third run in our Research to Startup 294 seminar series. Whereas
the first 2 classes were a high-level [intro to startups](/intro-sp22) and a
YC-inspired [launchpad](/launchpad-sp23) for students already working on startups,
this course is more of a traditional reading + discussion group and guest speaker
series.
