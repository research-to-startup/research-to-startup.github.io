<h1 class="title">CS 294 - Research to Startup</h1>

The project will consist of the following milestones and deliverables:

### Form teams
Starting on the first day of class you will meet other students in your area of interest. Come with general ideas for potential projects: a problem, a technology or a specific area you’d like to work on.

Get to know your classmates and shop around for teammates and a project topic you’d like to work on. Continue over Slack after class.

<h3><i>Feb 3rd: Submit your team of 3-6 students and your focus area.</i></h3>
Focus areas can be a specific problem you’d like to solve (e.g. energy consumption in buildings), a specific technology you want to commercialize (e.g. Spark) or a specific area you’d like to work on (e.g. developer tools for data scientists).


### Plan for customer/user interviews.
Based on the User Discovery lecture, you will build a plan for interviewing potential customers & users to learn about them and their needs. Your plan should include:
- Who you will initially approach and your plan to find more people to talk to
- Your User Discovery Interview Deck (3-4 slides)
- The list of questions you plan to ask

This will require you to come up with hypotheses of who your customer might be, what some of their pain points are, what features they will want. 

<h3><i>Feb 10: Submit your customer interview plan</i></h3>

### Conduct interviews
Conduct your first round of user interviews (at least 1 per teammate). Rotate through who leads the interviews so that each team member has a chance to lead at least 1 interview.

### Start to collect lessons learned:
- Document the personna(s) you have met.
- What user/customer pain points have you discovered?
- What common trends are emerging?
- What was most surprising?
- Which of your initial hypotheses were right/wrong?

<h3><i>Feb 24: Check-in on lessons learned from the first round of interviews.</i></h3>
Prepare a short slide deck (< 5 slides) or document (< 1/2 page) summarizing the findings of your first interviews and what you plan to focus on next. Have you uncovered a high-value user pain point?

### Continue interviews
Continue to talk to potential users/customers to refine your personas and identify pain points. As you hear about potentially significant pain-points, see if other users also have those pain-points. Complete at least 2 interviews per teammate.

### Summarize learnings & opportunity in a short presentation
Based on all of your interviews, come up with a summary of who is the customer/user and what are their pain-points. Prepare a short presentation on this to share with the class.

<h3><i>March 17: Present learnings & opportunity in class (5 min)</i></h3>

### Come up with solution & vision
Based on the personas and pain-points you’ve identified, come up with a feasible solution to their problem. What technology is required? What would be the minimal viable product?

From here, develop the bigger vision. If this solution is successful, what can it grow into? What is the long-term strategy? In 10 years, what could the product be and what impact could it have?

### Continue interviews
Talk to more customers/users. Have you identified a persona that has the same pain-point most of the time? Share your proposed MVP solution with customers/users. What is their reaction? How much would they be willing to pay if you could sell them this today ($10/month, $100/month, $1000/month, etc).

### Summarize into final pitch
- Create a final presentation summarizing at least:
- Who is the customer/user?
- What are their pain-points that you plan to solve?
- What is the MVP solution?
- What is your long-term vision?
Optionally, extend this a full pitch deck by adding the business model, market size, channels and differentiation.
