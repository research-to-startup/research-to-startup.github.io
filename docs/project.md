## Submission Instructions

* All milestones must be submitted via gradscope (you should have received an invite).
* There will be a gradescope assignment for each project milestone deadline.
* The project is for enrolled students only.
* For each milestone: first, one person per group must submit the assignment.
* **After submitting**, the submitter must add their team members to the submission via the 
  “View or edit group” link. Only enrolled students can be added as group members.<br/>

## Project Phases, Milestones, and Deliverables:

### Form teams
Starting on the first day of class you will meet other students in your area of
interest. Come with general ideas for potential projects: a problem, a
technology or a specific area you’d like to work on.

Get to know your classmates and shop around for teammates and a project topic
you’d like to work on. Continue over Slack after class.

Focus areas can be a specific problem you’d like to solve (e.g. energy
consumption in buildings), a specific technology you want to commercialize
(e.g. Spark) or a specific area you’d like to work on (e.g. developer tools for
data scientists).

#### Milestone 1) Feb 3rd: Submit your *team roster* (6 enrolled students or less) and your *focus area*

* **LATE SUBMISSIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED.**
* If you are not part of an on-time project submission, **YOU WILL BE DROPPED
  FROM THE COURSE**, and in general auditing of the course is not allowed.
* Project groups are flexible and can change for the next week. If you haven’t
  found a group by this first deadline, submit your assignment with just
  yourself as a one person group, and spend the next week finding another group
  to join or convincing people to join yours.<br/>
* **However, by Feb 10 (i.e., milestone #2 deadline), all groups must have at
  least 3 and no more than 6 team members that are enrolled in the course.**
* Projects are for enrolled students only or non-enrolled students that have
  been given permission from the instructors. If any waitlisters make it in,
  they will be given an extra week to join or form a team.


#### 1.a) By 2/10, all team rosters muust be finalized and have 3-6 team members that are enrolled in the course.

For this mini check-in milestone 1.a, each team must add a slide to the Project
check-in deck (shared via class slack) with their team name, final roster, and
current status of their idea/area.

### Plan for customer/user interviews
Based on the [User Discovery lecture on 1/20](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n70zF6oUF5S-xmafUdIz9SLm5E2YHd20/view?usp=sharing), you will build a plan for
interviewing potential customers and users to learn about them and their needs.
Your plan should include:

- List of at least 3 people you will initially approach and your plan to find more candidates.
    - **For this first round of meetings, a group of size X will ultimately need at least X distinct user interviews.** If you got permission to have a group with less than 3 members, you need at least 3 interviews.
    - Multiple group members can attend each meeting, each group member must attend at least one meeting.
    - Don't stress about this initial list too much. This list is just a starting spot. You do not need to interview everybody on this list. Your group can add and drop people from this list at your discretion as you work towards the required number of interviews for your group.
- Your User Discovery Interview Deck (3-4 slides)
    - Again, [the User Discovery lecture on 1/20](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n70zF6oUF5S-xmafUdIz9SLm5E2YHd20/view?usp=sharing) had examples of these slides (near the end).
- The list of questions you plan to ask.

This will require you to come up with hypotheses of who your customer might be,
what some of their pain points are, what features they will want. 

#### Milestone 2) <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Feb 10</span> Feb 14: Submit your customer interview plan

* Note that the deadline for Milestone 2 has been shifted later from Feb 10 to Feb 14, 2022.
* Make your Milestone 2 submission via Gradescope (don't forget to follow the [submission instructions](#submission-instructions) and add all group members to this submission as well!)

### Conduct interviews

Conduct your first round of user interviews (at least 1 per teammate). Rotate
through who leads the interviews so that each team member has a chance to lead
at least 1 interview.

### Start to collect lessons learned
- Document the personna(s) you have met.
- What user/customer pain points have you discovered?
- What common trends are emerging?
- What was most surprising?
- Which of your initial hypotheses were right/wrong?

#### Milestone 3) Feb 24: Report on lessons learned from the first round of interviews

Prepare a short slide deck (about 3-5 slides) or document (about 1/2 page)
summarizing the findings of your first interviews and what you plan to focus on
next. Have you uncovered a high-value user pain point?

### Continue interviews
Continue to talk to potential users/customers to refine your personas and
identify pain points. As you hear about potentially significant pain-points,
see if other users also have those pain-points. Complete at least 2 interviews
per teammate.

### Summarize learnings & opportunity in a short presentation
Based on all of your interviews, come up with a summary of who is the
customer/user and what are their pain-points. Prepare a short presentation on
this to share with the class.

#### Milestone 4) March 17: Present learnings & opportunity in class (5 min)

### Come up with solution & vision
Based on the personas and pain-points you’ve identified, come up with a
feasible solution to their problem. What technology is required? What would be
the minimal viable product?

From here, develop the bigger vision. If this solution is successful, what can
it grow into? What is the long-term strategy? In 10 years, what could the
product be and what impact could it have?

### Continue interviews
Talk to more customers/users. Have you identified a persona that has the same
pain-point most of the time? Share your proposed MVP solution with
customers/users. What is their reaction? How much would they be willing to pay
if you could sell them this today ($10/month, $100/month, $1000/month, etc).

Put together a short report on any new lessons learned during this second round
of user meetings and also include at least one slide that summarizes your vision
and solution. Extra points if you have a demo (even if it is just slides). This
can be an updated version of your original report on lessons learned, but the
new content should be called out clearly.

#### Milestone 5) April 14: Report on more lessons learned, solution, &amp; vision

### Summarize into final pitch

- Create a final presentation summarizing at least:
- Who is the customer/user?
- What are their pain-points that you plan to solve?
- What is the MVP solution?
- What is your long-term vision?

Optionally, extend this a full pitch deck by adding the business model, market
size, channels and differentiation. 

#### Milestone 6) May 12: Present pitch to the class (10 min)
